# Info

dwm for Gentoo with some of the patches
Enable the ones you wish to use with USE flags
`personal` USE flag is for some color, font and other custom settings that I use, you can safely ignore it

# Usage

Copy `x11-wm/dwm` directory in your local overlay and emerge `dwm`

if you already used dwm before with `savedconfig` USE flag enabled, then you will need to backup that one / delete it, in order for new config to be used.
