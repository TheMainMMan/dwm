# Info

dwm for Gentoo with some of the patches   
Enable the ones you wish to use with USE flags   

`personal` USE flag is for some color, font and other custom settings that I use   
you can safely ignore it or modify it to your liking   

# Usage

Copy `x11-wm/dwm` directory in your local overlay and emerge `dwm`   

if you already used dwm before with `savedconfig` USE flag enabled,   
you will need to backup that one / delete it, in order for new config to be used.
